As a developer I was hired to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This will help the user manage their tim more efficiently. The program is written so that the users event information is saved to the local storage. 




This app use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with dates and times.
